# RajbinHood Frontend

Used the following to bootstrap (for citation purposes)
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This part of the monorepo contains all React / FE related code. It's not quite
the best practices but I made it simple and it does the trick for demonstration
purposes.

This FE client consumes data from the rajbinhood_api; and it is intended to
display the disclaimer, show live updated tickers with price changes, and
display historical data in an interactive graph, also plug my sick portfolio.
